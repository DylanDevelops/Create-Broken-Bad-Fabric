# Create-Broken-Bad-Fabric - Dylan's Version
Unofficial fabric port of the mod "Create: Broken Bad." It has been modified a little bit for a server that I play on.

You are welcome to use this mod in your own servers, however, I reccommend sticking with the main unofficial port. If you play on forge, use the actual mod.

If after reading this, you still want to use my version of the mod, god help you.
